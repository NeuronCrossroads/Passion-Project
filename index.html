    <p>If the four letters that make up an organism's DNA(Deoxyribonucleic acid) are even subtly altered, it can mean certain death. Numerous methods of editing genetic code have sprung up since the discovery of DNA, each one with the acute danger of creating an erroneous edit. Now, CRISPR(Clustered Regularly Spaced Palindromic Repeats), has emerged and gene editing has changed for the better, becoming easier and safer. CRISPR is revolutionizing the way scientists modify genes and presenting limitless more opportunities to rewrite life.</p>
    <p>The world of genetic engineering extends to the farthest corners of our society.
     From editing animals and plants, to creating drugs, to curing illnesses, CRISPR will advance it beyond what we thought possible.
    With CRISPR/Cas9, life is our program, and we can change it more safely than ever.</p>
    <p>Explore the past of genetic modification to see how it changed the world.
     Learn what CRISPR is and how it was found in the immune system of one of the millions of bacteria.
   Then see what the genetic engineering and CRISPR have to offer in the near future.</p>

    <h1>Genetic Modification in the Past</h1>
    <hr class="barrier">
    <p>Genetic engineering isn't stuff of the future, but the reality of today.
      Genetic engineering has already hugely altered the way people live.
      CRISPR allows even more control of living things while doing it safely.</p>
    <h2>Genetic Diseases</h2>
    <div class="img-container">

      <p><small>A laboratory mouse, not unlike the mice Dr. Anderson used in his genetic experiments.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      One example of a result of research in recoding life is the advancement in curing genetic diseases.
      Daniel Anderson, a bioengineer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and his colleagues used Cas9 genes from CRISPR in mice to correct a flaw in the mice's genes that caused a metabolic disease called tyrosinemia(Ledford 21).
      A major roadblock in gene editing is making a mistake.
      These mistakes, no matter how small, can cause cancer and other terminal illnesses.
      That's why it is so important to use a safe method of editing genes.
      Curing one illness while causing another one that could be cancer would be detrimental to the patient's health.
    </p>
    <h2>Synthetic Drugs</h2>
    <div class="img-container">

      <p><small>A small bottle of insulin, made by genetically modifying bacteria to create it.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Some of the most momentous and important achievements of genetic modification was the creation of synthetic drugs.
      Certain hormones or chemicals are needed in the body and if a person cannot create it, they can be injected with it.
      These include the advent of synthetically creating insulin, human growth hormone(HGH), interferon, and bovine growth hormone(BGH)(Newton).
      Previously, these medicines were once extremely scarce or downright unnattainable.
      Now, they can be easily created and stored for whoever and whenever they're needed.
    </p>
    <h2>Transgenic Animals</h2>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/files/2012/10/cow.jpg" alt="">
      <p><small>Rosie, a seemingly ordinary cow at first, creates human, protien-enriched milk.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Beyond uses in rich countries, genetic engineering can help countries staggered by war, natural disasters, or famine get back on their feet.
      The first transgenic cow, Rosie, had human genes embedded into her cow genome.
      The milk that she produced was more similar to human milk than normal bovine milk; consequently, the milk contained more protein than normal milk.
      Cows like Rosie can make a huge impact in poor countries where people suffer from malnutrition(Newton).
      Genetic engineering has already made an impact in nearly all sectors of society and CRISPR can safely advance it far beyond the limits of people's imagination.
    </p>
    <h2>What else?</h2>
    <p>
       Other definite uses of CRISPR include to create the "cure of otherwise intractable diseases, a vastly more efficient system of food production, the more economical production of medicines, and other improvements to the world's way of life"(Newton).
       Control over how living cells work has allowed scientists to do impossible things that seem like science-fiction.
       Genetic engineering has already done so much for humanity, even with massive barriers in its advancement.
       With CRISPR, cures for diseases like tyrosinaemia and genetically enhanced animals like Rosie are just the beginning.

    <h1>What is CRISPR?</h1>

    </div>
    <h2>Where it Comes From</h2>
    <p>
      CRISPR has a long story for its discovery and essential workings.
      Essentially, CRISPR is a revolutionary new way to edit genes, but how and where did it come from?
      CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.
      It refers to palindromic repeats of DNA in a bacteria's genome.
      They are interspaced between sets of harmless viral DNA.
      Although they appear seemingly unimportant, they are crucial to the immune system of bacteria, which unlike ours, can be passed down from generation to generation("CRISPR").
      For example, this system activates when a virus attempts to infect a bacterial cell.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1: Virus Invasion</h2>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/21/fb/05/21fb05dddf4e8724606be665e4545a2c.jpg" alt="">
      <p><small>A virus has latched on and is injecting its DNA into the bacteria's DNA.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      When a bacterium is attacked by a virus, the virus inserts some of its DNA into the bacteria's nucleus.
      Once the bits of viral DNA have been injected into the chromosome of the cell, the cell's system creates a molecule called RNA(Ribonucleic Acid), which is an exact replicate of the viral DNA.
      RNA is extremely similar to DNA, allowing it to interact with DNA(Doudna).
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2: Build the Protein</h2>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0a/36/22/0a362261505b21084b97b89bb0a273c5.jpg" alt="">
      <p><small>A strand of RNA. Notice how it is only a single helix, not a double helix.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      This RNA copy of the virus begins to collate with the other essential parts to carry out the next step of the process.
      As crRNA(CRISPR RNA) from the Cas DNA system in the genome and tracrRNA that's a copy of the virus's DNA bind, they change into a complex called the Cas9 protein, the backbone of the CRISPR system.
      The Cas9 protein searches through the DNA of the bacteria until the sequence of DNA matches that of the RNA that is bound to the protein Cas9.
      When the site is found, the protein uses it's pair of enzymatic scissors to cut up the viral DNA.
      The complex is essentially a guided scissor that can cut the 2 strands of the double helix in DNA(Doudna).
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Find and Remove</h2>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/6508783/EssGen1-3_Primase_SQUARE_0.jpg" alt="">
      <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/04/science/04SUBGENES/04SUBGENES-master315-v2.jpg" alt="">
      <p><small>The DNA is "unzipped" in order to check its code(top). If the code is consistent, the protein cuts it(bottom).</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      This system opens up a spot for the newly introduced DNA can bind.
      At this location in the bacteria, it's harmless and instead creates a memory of the virus for the bacteria and its progeny.
    </p>
    <h2>Hack the system</h2>
    <div class="img-container">

      <p><small>Easily availible online, everything you need to edit genes in your home kitchen.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Those are CRISPR's origins, however, "scientists have learned how to harness CRISPR technology in the lab to make precise changes in the genes of organisms as diverse as fruit flies, fish, mice, plants and even human cells"("CRISPR").
      From being discovered in bacteria, to being used in labs across the world, CRISPR will revolutionize genetic engineering with its natural, safe, and precise processes.
