    <h1>CRISPR: Introduction</h1>
    <hr class="barrier">
    <p>If the four letters that make up an organism's DNA(Deoxyribonucleic acid) are even subtly altered, it can mean certain death. Numerous methods of editing genetic code have sprung up since the discovery of DNA, each one with the acute danger of creating an erroneous edit. Now, CRISPR(Clustered Regularly Spaced Palindromic Repeats), has emerged and gene editing has changed for the better, becoming easier and safer. CRISPR is revolutionizing the way scientists modify genes and presenting limitless more opportunities to rewrite life.</p>
    <p>The world of genetic engineering extends to the farthest corners of our society.
     From editing animals and plants, to creating drugs, to curing illnesses, CRISPR will advance it beyond what we thought possible.
    With CRISPR/Cas9, life is our program, and we can change it more safely than ever.</p>
    <p>Explore the past of genetic modification to see how it changed the world.
     Learn what CRISPR is and how it was found in the immune system of one of the millions of bacteria.
   Then see what the genetic engineering and CRISPR have to offer in the near future.</p>

    <h1>Genetic Modification in the Past</h1>
    <hr class="barrier">
    <p>Genetic engineering isn't stuff of the future, but the reality of today.
      Genetic engineering has already hugely altered the way people live.
      CRISPR allows even more control of living things while doing it safely.</p>
    <h2>Genetic Diseases</h2>
    <p>One example of a result of research in recoding life is the advancement in curing genetic diseases.
      Daniel Anderson, a bioengineer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and his colleagues used Cas9 genes from CRISPR in mice to correct a flaw in the mice's genes that caused a metabolic disease called tyrosinemia(Ledford 21).
      A major roadblock in gene editing is making a mistake.
      These mistakes, no matter how small, can cause cancer and other terminal illnesses.
    That's why it is so important to use a safe method of editing genes.
  Curing one illness while causing another one that could be cancer would be detrimental to the patient's health.</p>
