    <p>If the four letters that make up an organism's DNA(Deoxyribonucleic acid) are even subtly altered, it can mean certain death.
      Numerous methods of editing genetic code have sprung up since the discovery of DNA, each one with the acute danger of creating an erroneous edit.
      That was the main hurdle in many genetic experiments.
      People didn't want to edit life and come up with something that would wipe it out.
      At the time people wanted nothing to do with editing the basic constructs of what we are.
      Now, CRISPR(Clustered Regularly Spaced Palindromic Repeats), has emerged and gene editing has changed for the better, becoming easier and safer.
      CRISPR is revolutionizing the way scientists modify genes and presenting limitless more opportunities to rewrite life.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the work of 2 intrepid scientists, Jennifer Doudna and  Emmanuelle Charpentier, a new way to edit genes has come into perspective for some of the most skeptic people.
      The world of genetic engineering extends to the farthest corners of our society.
     From editing animals and plants, to creating drugs, to curing illnesses, CRISPR will advance it beyond what we thought possible.
    With CRISPR/Cas9, life is our program, and we can change it more safely than ever.</p>
    <p>Explore the past of genetic modification to see how it changed the world.
     Learn what CRISPR is and how it was found in the immune system of one of the millions of bacteria.
   Then see what the genetic engineering and CRISPR have to offer in the near future.</p>

    <h1>Genetic Modification in the Past</h1>
    <hr class="barrier">
    <p>Genetic engineering isn't stuff of the future, but the reality of today.
      Genetic engineering has already hugely altered the way people live.
      CRISPR allows even more control of living things while doing it safely.</p>
    <h2>Hereditary Diseases</h2>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Lab_mouse_mg_3216.jpg" alt="">
      <p><small>A laboratory mouse, not unlike the mice Dr. Anderson used in his genetic experiments.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      One example of a result of research in recoding life is the advancement in curing genetic diseases.
      Daniel Anderson, a bioengineer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and his colleagues used Cas9 genes from CRISPR in mice to correct a flaw in the mice's genes that caused a metabolic disease called tyrosinemia(Ledford 21).
      A major roadblock in gene editing is making a mistake.
      These mistakes, no matter how small, can cause cancer and other terminal illnesses.
      That's why it is so important to use a safe method of editing genes.
      Curing one illness while causing another one that could be cancer would be detrimental to the patient's health.
    </p>
    <h2>Synthetic Drugs</h2>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="http://img.medscape.com/thumbnail_library/dt_160208_insulin_800x600.jpg" alt="">
      <p><small>A small bottle of insulin, made by genetically modifying bacteria to create it.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Some of the most momentous and important achievements of genetic modification was the creation of synthetic drugs.
      Certain hormones or chemicals are needed in the body and if a person cannot create it, they can be injected with it.
      These include the advent of synthetically creating insulin, human growth hormone(HGH), interferon, and bovine growth hormone(BGH)(Newton).
      Previously, these medicines were once extremely scarce or downright unnattainable.
      Now, they can be easily created and stored for whoever and whenever they're needed.
    </p>
    <h2>Transgenic Animals</h2>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/files/2012/10/cow.jpg" alt="">
      <p><small>Rosie, a seemingly ordinary cow at first, creates human, protien-enriched milk.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Beyond uses in rich countries, genetic engineering can help countries staggered by war, natural disasters, or famine get back on their feet.
      The first transgenic cow, Rosie, had human genes embedded into her cow genome.
      The milk that she produced was more similar to human milk than normal bovine milk; consequently, the milk contained more protein than normal milk.
      Cows like Rosie can make a huge impact in poor countries where people suffer from malnutrition(Newton).
      Genetic engineering has already made an impact in nearly all sectors of society and CRISPR can safely advance it far beyond the limits of people's imagination.
    </p>
    <h2>What else?</h2>
    <p>
       Other definite uses of CRISPR include to create the "cure of otherwise intractable diseases, a vastly more efficient system of food production, the more economical production of medicines, and other improvements to the world's way of life"(Newton).
       Control over how living cells work has allowed scientists to do impossible things that seem like science-fiction.
       Genetic engineering has already done so much for humanity, even with massive barriers in its advancement.
       With CRISPR, cures for diseases like tyrosinaemia and genetically enhanced animals like Rosie are just the beginning.

  <div id="what" style="border: 10px solid green;" class="info-box">
    <h1>What is CRISPR?</h1>
    <hr class="barrier">
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/news_images/crispr750.jpg" alt="">
      <p><small>This is a model of a Cas9 protein searching through a chromosome's DNA.</small></p>
    </div>
    <h2>Where it Comes From</h2>
    <p>
      CRISPR has a long story for its discovery and essential workings.
      Essentially, CRISPR is a revolutionary new way to edit genes, but how and where did it come from?
      CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.
      It refers to palindromic repeats of DNA in a bacteria's genome.
      They are interspaced between sets of harmless viral DNA.
      Although they appear seemingly unimportant, they are crucial to the immune system of bacteria, which unlike ours, can be passed down from generation to generation("CRISPR").
      For example, this system activates when a virus attempts to infect a bacterial cell.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1: Virus Invasion</h2>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/21/fb/05/21fb05dddf4e8724606be665e4545a2c.jpg" alt="">
      <p><small>A virus has latched on and is injecting its DNA into the bacteria's DNA.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      When a bacterium is attacked by a virus, the virus inserts some of its DNA into the bacteria's nucleus.
      Once the bits of viral DNA have been injected into the chromosome of the cell, the cell's system creates a molecule called RNA(Ribonucleic Acid), which is an exact replicate of the viral DNA.
      RNA is extremely similar to DNA, allowing it to interact with DNA(Doudna).
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2: Build the Protein</h2>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0a/36/22/0a362261505b21084b97b89bb0a273c5.jpg" alt="">
      <p><small>A strand of RNA. Notice how it is only a single helix, not a double helix.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      This RNA copy of the virus begins to collate with the other essential parts to carry out the next step of the process.
      As crRNA(CRISPR RNA) from the Cas DNA system in the genome and tracrRNA that's a copy of the virus's DNA bind, they change into a complex called the Cas9 protein, the backbone of the CRISPR system.
      The Cas9 protein searches through the DNA of the bacteria until the sequence of DNA matches that of the RNA that is bound to the protein Cas9.
      When the site is found, the protein uses it's pair of enzymatic scissors to cut up the viral DNA.
      The complex is essentially a guided scissor that can cut the 2 strands of the double helix in DNA(Doudna).
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Find and Remove</h2>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/ne0000/6508783/EssGen1-3_Primase_SQUARE_0.jpg" alt="">
      <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/04/science/04SUBGENES/04SUBGENES-master315-v2.jpg" alt="">
      <p><small>The DNA is "unzipped" in order to check its code(top). If the code is consistent, the protein cuts that gene(bottom).</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      This system opens up a spot for the newly introduced DNA can bind.
      At this location in the bacteria, it's harmless and instead creates a memory of the virus for the bacteria and its progeny.
    </p>
    <h2>Hack the system</h2>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="http://img-1.newatlas.com/home-crispr-genome-editing-kit-4.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&ch=Width%2CDPR&fit=crop&h=347&q=60&rect=0%2C29%2C1200%2C675&w=616&s=0dd10bb9a2d9e3ca98263e54d99f1a1c" alt="">
      <p><small>Easily availible online, everything you need to edit genes in your home kitchen.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Those are CRISPR's origins, however, "scientists have learned how to harness CRISPR technology in the lab to make precise changes in the genes of organisms as diverse as fruit flies, fish, mice, plants and even human cells"("CRISPR").
      They do this by placing their own code into the protein.
      This way, the protein only cuts the genes at the location that the scienctists want.
      This helps create a safe and reliable method for editing genes.
      From being discovered in bacteria, to being used in labs across the world, CRISPR will revolutionize genetic engineering with its natural, safe, and precise processes.
    </p>

  <div id="future" style="border: 10px solid blue;" class="info-box">
    <h1>DNA of the Future</h1>
    <hr class="barrier">
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="https://i1.wp.com/securityaffairs.co/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DNA-Cryptography-2.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>
      CRISPR's ability to edit genes with unprecedented precision is opening the door to a plethora of uses in the future.
      Safety was a major inhibitor during research in genetics.
      Governments wouldn't allow many treatments to advance due to safety concerns.
      CRISPR's capabilities of precision change that, allowing research to accelerate.
    </p>
    <h2>Genetic Vaccine</h2>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/zikavaccine.jpg?sw=1024&cx=0&cy=0&cw=2000&ch=1499" alt="">
      <p><small>"Genetic" Zika vaccine.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      In the near future, diseases may finally be on their knees with CRISPR.
      The Zika DNA vaccine being tested among other DNA vaccines contains genetic material from the virus, once injected into the muscle causes the body to create an immune response to the virus(Mullin).
      Although this may seem far-fetch after realizing the numerous groups of scientists have tried and ultimately failed trying to create a vaccine for Zika, it is undoubtedly true.
      "In a call with reporters on [March 31, 2017], [Anthony] Fauci [immunologist] said initial results in 40 volunteers indicate that the vaccine produced an immune response against Zika and didn't cause serious side effects"(Mullin).
      Along with other a vaccine for Zika, the method's flexibility allows other vaccines to be created as well.
      For example, "the NIH [National Institutes of Health] has created a DNA vaccine against West Nile Virus, although it was never commercialized"(Mullin).
    </p>
    <h2>Gene Drives</h2>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/03/02/mosquitos-texas_custom-4bea469c6b65e34969654eab1d9bbfa54e86ab94-s900-c85.jpg" alt="">
      <p><small>"Genetic" Zika vaccine.</small></p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Speaking of Zika, it is carried by mosquitos.
      Mosquitos have plagued humans since their first existance, carrying deadly diseases from one person to another.
      Scientists have begun working on a project to create "Gene Drives".
      The basic rule of sexual reproduction states that there is a 50% chance of genes being inherited from a parent.
      However, CRISPR can modify the genes in such a way, it can receive a "boost" and nearly have a 100% chance of being passed on to its progeny.
      This allows a gene to prevent a mosquito from carrying diseases to rapidly proliferate through a population of insects.
      In other words, it has the potential to eradicate a whole population of mosquitoes that could carry disease(Ledford 24).
      In the near future, the world's greatest killer, disease carrying mosquitos, may finally be vanquished under CRISPR.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The future of CRISPR will bring an end to many devastating illnesses while bringing in new technologies to make lives more comfortable.
      Rewriting life has been a key interest in the science community on account of learning about DNA, but with CRISPR, people can change genes with unparalleled precision.
      The future rests in programming, whether it be computers or life. With CRISPR, doctors can correct birth defects, get rid of problematic genetic disorders, and cure otherwise incurable diseases.
      As new improvements are discovered every day CRISPR will solve problems society never thought solvable; changing the world forever.

    <h1>What Else Can You Do?</h1>
    <hr class="barrier">
    <p>
      There dozens, hundreds, maybe even thousands of places where gene editing can be utilized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of all the problems you have around you.
      Maybe you are fatter than you would like to be.
      Maybe you are slower than you would like to be.
      Maybe, you can't find healthy food at the grocery store.
      Maybe, you are sick and aren't able to do the basic tasks in a day.
    </p>
    <p>There are so many ways to use genetic engineering:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Get rid of diseases, birth disorders, or even cancer
      <li>Modify animals to be more useful
      <li>Create one of the strongest fibers in the world, spider silk
      <li>Create tougher armor for soldiers
      <li>Cure alzheimers
      <li>Cure parkinsons
      <li>Increase anyone's lifespan
      <li>Grow organs for anyone who needs them
      <li>Regenerate a paralyzed person's spinal cord to let them walk again
      <li>Make our garden plants more resistant to disease
      <li>Bring back extinct animals
      <li>Stop the deterioration of ecosystems
    </ol>
    <p>
      There are so many different things that genetic engineering can change.
      It can make our everyday lives better and even lengthen those lives.
      However, there are dangers that come from using genetic engineering as discussed in "Ethics".
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="ethics" class="info-box" style="border: 10px solid lightgreen;">
    <h1>There Must Be Some Rules</h1>
    <hr class="barrier">
    <img src="http://www.ac-grenoble.fr/disciplines/anglais/img/gene_ethics.gif" alt="">
    <hr class="barrier">
    <p>
      Control over the genomes of living things has its obvious benefits.
      However, there are ethical issues and dangers in testing modified organisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are some ethical problems people have in the use of gene therapies:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>How could someone distinguish what is a bad or good way to use gene therapy?
      <li>Who decides that traits are normal and which cause a disability or disorder.
      <li>Since gene therapy is so expensive, who will be able to use it?
      <li>If gene therapy can change how we look, will people be less accepting of people who do not receive it?
      <li>Should gene therapy be used to enhance basic human traits such as height, intelligence, or athletic ability?
    </ol>
    <p>
      These are a few of the many problems that arise when people publicly announce their advancements in genetic modification.
      Of course there must be some rules.
      These questions and many others like them wil have to be resolved before many products are released to the public.
      The gap between low-paying job workers and the upper class will increase if expensive ability-enhancing gene therapies are used.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also terrible dangers ahead of people have easy access to the tools necessary to modify genes.
      If someone can modifiy bacteria to resist antibiotics, then there could be an epidemic.
      Although there are many hurdles in creating such a plague, a determined person can do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if someone could write disease out of our lives, would we tell them to do it?
      Many people would say "Yes!", but what risk are we taking by doing that?
      Any radical way to change life into something we can mold to the utmost degree has and will be hotly contested.
      That's how it was for the steam engine, airplane, and the nuclear bomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world changes every day, but life doesn't.
      Life takes millions of years to change and evolve.
      Genetic engineering may be the key to the future, the key to eradicate diseases, the key to have an unlimited supply of food.
      There are dozens of breakthroughs happening every day and each one brings us one step closer.
      A civilian's job in genetics is to stay informed of what is going on.
      The risks and dangers are meant to be overseen by the population.
      That's the role you play in the world of genetics.
